# SurfsUp Overview

This repository covers temperature trends in Oahu for the months of June and December from 2010 to 2017. The data presented here will help determine if a combination surf/ice cream shop will be sustainable. 

The data first came in the form of a sqlite file, which was then sorted and transferred into a Pandas dataframe. 

## Results

The results look good for the sustainability of a surf and ice cream shop as temperature does not differ very much year-round.

-The maximum temperature (Fahrenheit) in Oahu in June from 2010 to 2017 was 85*.

-The minimum temperature (Fahrenheit) for the same time period was 64*.

-The average temperature (Fahrenheit) for this time frame was 74.94*

June statistics 

-The maximum temperature (Fahrenheit) in Oahu in December 2010 to 2017 was 83*.

-The minimum temperature (Fahrenheit) for this same time period was 56*.

-The average temperature (Fahrenheit) during this time period was 71.04*.

December statistics 

The average temperature between these months (of opposite seasons) is less that 4* apart. This tells us that a shop such as this would not be considered seasonal but instead a year-round business that could easily be sustained. 

## Summary

In summary, a combination surf/ice cream shop could be sustained based on the temperature data from Oahu. It would seem the island does not have four seasons of varying weather but instead has similar weather all year. This is good for a shop such as this that may be affected by cold weather conditions. 

A couple things I would add to further back up the data here are hurricanes/ storms and rain totals. Hurricanes hurt tourism which would in turn hurt business at the shop. Rain totals would also affect tourism if one month was known for rain over others. These two data points would also keep the casual, fair weather surfer from venturing out.
